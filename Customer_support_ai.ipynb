      "Final Answer: To help DeepLearningAI add memory to their crew in CrewAI, you can equip your agents with custom tools that interact with external memory services such as databases or cloud storage. This can be done by using the \"Flexible Tools\" feature in CrewAI, which allows you to customize the tools for each agent. Here is a simplified example of how you can create a custom tool for memory management:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a Python class that represents the memory tool:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai.tools.base import Tool\n",
      "\n",
      "class MemoryTool(Tool):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n",
      "        self.memory_storage = kwargs.get(\"memory_storage\", None)\n",
      "\n",
      "    def execute(self, context, input):\n",
      "        # Implement the memory-related operations here\n",
      "        pass\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Define the memory tool in your crew configuration:\n",
      "\n",
      "```yaml\n",
      "tools:\n",
      "  my_memory_tool:\n",
      "    class: MemoryTool\n",
      "    kwargs:\n",
      "      memory_storage: my_database  # The name of the memory storage service, e.g., a database\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Assign the memory tool to the relevant agents in your crew:\n",
      "\n",
      "```yaml\n",
      "agents:\n",
      "  my_agent:\n",
      "    tools:\n",
      "      - my_memory_tool\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use the memory tool in your agents' code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai.tools.my_memory_tool import MemoryTool\n",
      "\n",
      "def on_task_start(context, input):\n",
      "    memory_tool = context.get_tool(\"my_memory_tool\")\n",
      "    # Access and manipulate the memory storage using the memory_tool object\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, DeepLearningAI can add custom memory management capabilities to their agents in CrewAI. Keep in mind that you might need to adapt this example to better fit your specific needs and requirements.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",

Here is a simplified example of how you can create a custom tool for memory management:\n",

      "Dear DeepLearningAI team,\n",

      "Thank you for reaching out to us with your inquiry about creating a custom memory tool in CrewAI for your agents. I'm happy to help you with this request and provide a detailed step-by-step guide to help you achieve your goal.\n",

      "To create a custom memory tool, you can follow these four steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a custom tool class in Python that interacts with the desired memory service. Here is a simplified example of such a class:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai.tools.base import Tool\n",
      "\n",
      "class MemoryTool(Tool):\n",

      "    def execute(self, context, input):\n",
      "        # Implement the memory-related operations here\n",
      "        pass\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Define the tool in a YAML configuration file. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```yaml\n",
      "tools:\n",
      "  my_memory_tool:\n",
      "    class: MemoryTool\n",

      "      memory_storage: my_database  # The name of the memory storage service, e.g., a database\n",
